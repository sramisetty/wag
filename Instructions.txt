Import single EAB into data parser

For each same Page (Col A) and Layout (Col B), collect all WICs into a set.
Match that set against WAG History for exact same set of WICs if exists and pull in Headline and Body Copy.

If not, use WICs in set to then collect UPCs from WAG Master Item, collect them as a set and bounce those against an API/AI to generate Headline and Body Copy.

Take a look at the PDFs and matching EAB.
